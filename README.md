TPU accelerated Rasperrypi Aimbot

This project was made to expose that an object detection aimbot and run on a raspberry pi.

Note that I will not be sharing any modals that I end up training for this project, becuse I do not want them to be used to cheat. I have provide the script that I used
to quantize the Tensor Flow graphs becuse it has alot of other uses beyond this aimbot.
