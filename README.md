TPU accelerated Rasperrypi Aimbot
For More explination of this project watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvwjC1_Luo

This project was made to expose that an object detection aimbot can run on a raspberry pi.

program that runs tflite modal is Aim Lab Testing/ShootEnemy.py
script for quantizing Modals for tpu eceleration is in Quant_Script.ipynb

Note that I will not be sharing any modals that I end up training for this project, becuse I do not want them to be used to cheat. I have provide the script that I used
to quantize the Tensor Flow graphs becuse it has alot of other uses beyond this aimbot.
